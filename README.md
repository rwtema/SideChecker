SideChecker
======

A coremod designed to check classes as they are loading and ensure that any code that calls a client-side code (i.e. code that is marked with @SideOnly(Side.CLIENT) and therefore not present in a server enviroment) is also marked with @SideOnly(Side.CLIENT).


Note: This is meant to only be used in an deobfuscated enviroment.

Installation
==============
Please note that this is for mod developers only, and is of no use to regular players.

Download the latest compiled jar and add it to your run directory /mods/ folder.

Downloads
==============
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/mn5qs3pz195pgl4/SideChecker-1.1.jar">Version 1.1</a><br>
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download/2yeqy4fsvualbpa/SideChecker-1.0.jar">Version 1.0</a><br>

Options
==============
Add the following VM options to configure the coreMods behaviour

<b>-DSideChecker.filter=%packagename%</b><br>
By default only classes in the 'production' directory are checked (i.e. classes than can be edited by the IDE) . If this filter is present then any class that starts with the package name will be checked.

<b>-DSideChecker.clientSafeAnnotation=%classname%</b><br>
If for some reason you wish to not use @SideOnly, then you can use the annotation given by 'clientSafeAnnotation' to mark a method as 'safe'.

<b>-DSideChecker.crashOnError=true</b><br>
When present, this will stop the execution whenever a serious error occurs.

<b>-DSideChecker.crashOnWarning=true</b><br>
The same as above, except it will also stop execution when a warning is detected.
